{opt mcsens} is used to calculate the multiclass sensitivity of a predicted outcome variable relative to an observed outcome variable.  Multiclass sensitivity is calculated as the total number of true postive predicted outcomes of each class divided by total observed outcomes.  For more details see the {browse "https://yardstick.tidymodels.org/reference/sens.html":yardstick} reference page. 



{phang}
{opt mcprec} is used to calculate the multiclass precision of a predicted outcome variable relative to an observed outcome variable.  Multiclass precision is calculated as the total number of true postive predicted outcomes of each class divided by total predicted outcomes. For more details see the {browse "https://yardstick.tidymodels.org/reference/precision.html":yardstick} reference page. 



{phang}
{opt mcrecall} is used to calculate the multiclass recall of a predicted outcome variable relative to an observed outcome variable. Multiclass recall is a synonym for multiclass sensitivity.  For more details see the {browse "https://yardstick.tidymodels.org/reference/recall.html":yardstick} reference page. 



{phang}
{opt mcspec} is used to calculate the multiclass specificity of a predicted outcome variable relative to an observed outcome variable.  Multiclass specificity is calculated as the total number of true negative predicted outcomes of each class divided by the total of true negative and false positive outcomes of each class.  For more details see the {browse "https://yardstick.tidymodels.org/reference/spec.html":yardstick} reference page. 



{phang}
{opt mcppv} is used to calculate multiclass positive predicted values (PPV). As in the binary case, multiclass PPV can be understood as the share of predicted positives that are actually positive. Multiclass PPV is defined identically to multiclass precision.  For more details see the {browse "https://yardstick.tidymodels.org/reference/ppv.html":yardstick} reference page. 



{phang}
{opt mcnpv} is used to calculate multiclass negative predicted values (NPV). As in the binary case, multiclass NPV can be understood as the share of predicted negatives that are actually negative.  For more details see the {browse "https://yardstick.tidymodels.org/reference/npv.html":yardstick} reference page. 



{phang}
{opt mcacc} is used to calculate the multiclass accuracy of a predicted outcome variable relative to an observed outcome variable.  In both binary and multiclass cases, accuracy can be understood as the share of the data predicted correctly and is the ratio of true positives plus true negatives relative to all predicted outcomes.  This option is identical to the binary accuracy option, acc.  For more details see the {browse "https://yardstick.tidymodels.org/reference/accuracy.html":yardstick} reference page.



{phang}
{opt mcbacc} is used to calcuate the multiclass balanced accuracy of a predicted outcome variable relative to an observed outcome variable. Multiclass balanced accuracy can be understood as the unweighted mean of multiclass sensitivity and multiclass specificity.  For more details see the {browse "https://yardstick.tidymodels.org/reference/bal_accuracy.html":yardstick} reference page.



{phang}
{opt mcmcc} is used to calculate Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC).  The MCC is a correlation coefficient between the observed and predicted binary variables that range from [âˆ’1, 1].  This option is identical to the binary Matthews correlation coefficient option, mcc.  For more details see the {browse "https://yardstick.tidymodels.org/reference/mcc.html":yardstick} reference page.



{phang}
{opt mcf1} is used to calculate the multiclass F1 score. The F1 score is an alternate measure of a model's accuracy.  F1 score is calculated as the harmonic mean of the multiclass precision and recall metrics.  For more details see the {browse "https://yardstick.tidymodels.org/reference/f_meas.html":yardstick} reference page.



{phang}
{opt mcjindex} is used to calculate multiclass Youden's J statistic (J-index). The J statistic is defined as the sum of the multiclass sensitivity and specificity minus one and ranges from [0, 1].  For more details see the {browse "https://yardstick.tidymodels.org/reference/j_index.html":yardstick} reference page. 



{phang}
{opt mcordr2} is used to calculate the polychoric correlation of two ordinal variables.  This option requires the installation of {search polychoric}. For more details see the {help polychoric} help page. 



{phang}
{opt mcdetect} is used to calculate the multiclass detection prevalence. Multiclass detection prevalence is defined as the sum of true posttive and false positive predicted outcomes for each class divided by the total number of predicted outcomes.  For more details see the {browse "https://yardstick.tidymodels.org/reference/detection_prevalence.html":yardstick} reference page.  



{phang}
{opt mckappa} is used to calculate the multiclass Kappa. Kappa is similar to multiclass accuracy but is normalized by the accuracy expected by random chance.    For more details see the {browse "https://yardstick.tidymodels.org/reference/kap.html":yardstick} reference page.
